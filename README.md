# Forth language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to Gforth files in [Atom](https://atom.io).
Note will work for most Forth files also as this package was forked from language-forth !
I added highlighting for the objects.fs file included with Gforth. 

Install it via the Settings Pane or by using the Atom Package Manager:

    apm install language-gforth-objects
